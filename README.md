SmartClose
==========

SmartClose is a Windows system tool that automates the task of closing all running programs. It can also save the state of the system to a snapshot so that all closed programs can be started again later with minimal effort. This repository contains the Delphi source code of SmartClose.

Let me start by admitting that the main part of the SmartClose source code is rubbish. I have written most of it in the early 2000s, before I had any real experience with coding and before I followed computer science studies at university. So I was blatantly unaware of good coding practices such as object-oriented programming. This becomes clear very quickly once you start browsing through the source code.

The reason, then, why I have put the source code online is for educational purposes; to show how SmartClose works under the hood and how certain things are done. Another reason is that people have asked me for the source code. If you have any plans for making major improvements to the program, then I would *strongly* suggest to just completely rewrite it. This might be a big task at first, but it would certainly give better results in the end than applying hack after hack on the current messy code.

Pull requests for minor improvements are always welcome, although I can't guarantee that they will ever be released in a new version. I have lost interest in working on SmartClose a long time ago and have moved on to other projects since.
