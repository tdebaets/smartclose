Expand built-in critical programs:

"Critical system services include smss.exe, csrss.exe, winit.exe, logonui.exe, lsass.exe, services.exe, winlogon.exe, System, svchost.exe with RPCSS, and svchost.exe with Dcom/PnP."

New way to close programs (more like shutdown):

send WM_QUERYENDSESSION to each windowed app (timeout 5sec)
send WM_ENDSESSION to each windowed app (timeout 5sec)
(give each windowed app another 5sec and then) send WM_CLOSE (timeout 5sec)
do other stuff (expwins, services...)
wait until each windowed app had 20sec to close
send messages to visible windows first
if 2 messages timeout -> hung app

(internet) explorer windows

- bug: select screen saver+snapshot task, next, back, deselect snapshot, next, "snapshot already exists"
- bug: Kopie van Default2.scss: uncheck "restore expwins", wizard runs but nothing to do
- restore: disable fs redirection on x64
- only open processes once and add hProc field to TProcWinObj
- when closing processes, keep track of which ones get closed in a separate thread (use TProcWaitThread like when restoring)
- only close processes of current user and leave other users (fast user switching) alone
- close older or parentless processes first - close procs with (visible) windows first
- make smss.exe & csrss.exe critical!
- make critical process checking smarter by comparing full filename (or by checking for system dir)
- give focus to txtSnapPath when selecting 'custom location' option
- don't inject anymore to get curdir/commandline, but use NtQueryInformationProcess
http://wj32.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/howto-get-the-command-line-of-processes/
- make sure that VirtualFreeEx actually frees the allocated block
- use separate 64-bit process for smartkill?
- 64-bit CreateRemoteThread?
- make smartkill work again on win 9x/ME (use disassembly of EliRT?)
- test with DEP
- remove iexplore.exe from critical processes but recognize iexplore.exe while closing and close its IE windows instead + same for explorer.exe?
- use GetApplicationRestartSettings? (vista+)
- bug: black icon in frmConfig's icoSnap
- for Explorer windows, save their PIDL instead of path in snapshots (ishellbrowser ishellview ifolderview ishellfolder)
- missing setfocus after corrupt snapshot warning
- bug: comment at start of snapshots not always saved
- disable restore screen saver task when no screen saver is currently set
- hang on browse for snapshot folder?
- check for & take mutex during close/restore process
- close dos/console programs? (CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT)
- improve waiting on start/stop of a service
- in GetParentPID, verify parent creation time (parent PID could have been reused)
- support closing/restoring of IE7 tabs
- load process list on the fly and show icons later (remove frmWait)
- TExtChkListView: prettier check boxes with visual styles disabled
- disable close explorer windows task when IE version < 4
- also wait when closing explorer windows, just like with process windows
- test closing of outlook (no crash?)
- www.awasu.com & www.surfulater.com crash on close attempt
- show native tooltips everywhere instead of delphi's
- frmMain: use native balloon tooltips
- alternative mode for protected programs: inclusive, only select programs to be closed (use TProcessListView)
- recognize service processes while closing and stop the containing services instead of regular closing/killing
- option to review the list of closed/killed programs
- cleanup system tray http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10807/Shell-Tray-Info-Arrange-your-system-tray-icons
- save logs to file (only on /debug?)
- close/restore firefox sessions
- advanced: per-program rules
- disable Power Management options (turn off screen, hard drive...)
- disconnect network/internet connections
- allow unattended run of the close/restore wizard
- remember window size/state of programs (minimized/maximized...)
- use GetProcessShutdownParameters?
- running object table: IFileIsInUse /IOleWindow::GetWindow()
- plugins/scripts
- automation
